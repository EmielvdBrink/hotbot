###Aegeus
This is a small, extensible bot which is design with kotlin, intended to run on one guild and one guild only.
You may fork it and use it as you like. The focus of this project is learning. 

###Help information
This is to come later, not sure if I want this to be built onto a webservice or simply to use embeds.

###Contact 
You can freely contact me about this bot through the server it is intended to be used on, here:
